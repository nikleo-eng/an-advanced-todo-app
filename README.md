An example of an *MVC Maven* project; the project is built with *GitHub Actions* (on Ubuntu, MacOS and Windows); the *Repository components* use *MySQL* as target DBMS (an RDBMS): the project can be extended to connect to another RDBMS or even to a NoSQL DBMS, like MongoDB; *JavaFX* is at the base of the *UI components*: the project can also use an other GUI framework, like Swing, or even a CLI; the project contains *Unit, UI, IT, E2E and BDD Tests* (with *TestFX* and *Cucumber*); the project uses *Guice* as *DI framework* ; the project is analyzable with *SonarQube* and it is analyzed with *SonarCloud* from GitHub Actions; for the project's tests' execution, an empty *dockerized image of a MySQL instance* is provided (both for Linux and Windows containers); for academic purposes, also a *Docker Compose* example (with two services and a network) is provided (both for Linux and Windows containers): the example can be used as an E2E test for assuring that the builded, dockerized and running Java application can connect to a dockerized MySQL instance; the code coverage is calculated with *JaCoCo*, while the reliability of the *Controller components* is guaranteed with *Mutation Tests* (with *PIT*); finally, a *Maven wrapper* has been added.
