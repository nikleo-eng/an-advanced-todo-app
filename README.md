An example of a _MVC Maven_ project; the project is built with _GitHub Actions_ (on Ubuntu, MacOS and Windows); the _Repository components_ use _MySQL_ as target DBMS (an RDBMS): the project can be extended to connect to another RDBMS o even to a NoSQL DBMS, like MongoDB; _JavaFX_ is at the base of the _UI components_ : the project can also use an other GUI framework, like Swing, or even a CLI; the project contains _Unit, UI, IT, E2E and BDD Tests_ (with _TestFX_ and _Cucumber_ ); the project uses _Guice_ as _DI framework_ ; the project is analizable with _SonarQube_ and it is analyzed with _SonarCloud_ from GitHub Actions; for the project's tests' execution, a empty _dockerized image of a MySQL instance_ is provided (both for Linux and Windows containers); for academic purposes, also a _Docker Compose_ example (with two services and a network) is provided (both for Linux and Windows containers): the example can be used as E2E test for assuring that the builded, dockerized and running Java application can connect to a dockerized MySQL instance; the code coverage is calculated with _JaCoCo_ , while the reliability of the _Controller components_ is garanted with _Mutation Tests_ (with _PIT_ ); finally, a _Maven wrapper_ has been added.
